	<div class="one-half column"><h5>hello.</h5><p>my name is Dean Taylor.</p>

		<p>i'm a berlin-based designer, creative technologist and musician.</p>

		<p>in 2019, i founded an interactive art and design studio called <a href="http://www.instagram.com/eastlabbln">eastlab.</a> here we are dealing with interactive design and installations.</p>

		<p>my relationship with design was born from my love of technology, the digital world, and physical form. honestly though, I canâ€™t deny that sci-fi movies and techno had a part to play in it!</p>
		<p>i am passionate about bringing the digital world into a physical context in order to create stronger bonds with technology. i believe good communication is key to creating strong relationships with people, and i believe this isn't unlike our behaviour towards design and technology.</p>

			<p>if you have any questions or would like to hire me, please contact me at: <a href="mailto:me@deantaylordesign.com">me@deantaylordesign.com</a></p><p>thank you.</p>
